Over the course of my academic career I've worked on several projects across different disciplines. Here are three that I'd like to show.

# 1. AAE 450: Project NextStep - Orbital Rendezvous for Low-Lunar and Low-Earth Orbit

Orbital Rendezvous is when you get two spacecrafts to meet up at the same location, time and with no relative velocity between both spacecrafts so they can attach to each other. For example, in the case of our project, we had to perform analysis to see how we could achieve orbital rendezvous to allow a lunar surface bound spacecraft to dock with a refueling station.

The video linked below shows a set of GMAT simulations that illustrate this process.

Another aspect of our mission analysis project that we performed was to depart the Earth towards the moon on a free-return trajectory. A free-return trajectory in our case is when we depart from Earth and fly by the moon and return back to earth without the use of any propellant.

The video linked below shows the results of our GMAT simulations and analysis that illustrate this process. The first six seconds of this video show the free-return trajectory. Note that viewed in a moon-fixed frame, i.e. we are viewing the spacecraft and earth from the reference frame of the moon and thus the position of the moon is "held constant". Starting from about 14 seconds in, the video shows another form of orbital rendezvous, where orbital rendezvous is performed in lunar orbit. Observe, how the MoonSat altitude slowly drops to the Spacecraft altitude until rendezvous is achieved.

The project is explained in more extensive detail in the report below:
